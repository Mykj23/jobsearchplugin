# jobsearchplugin


Hey Zak so basically I am trying to modify the search filter boxes.
Primarily the States/Cities box. We have 200+ cities in there so to get to the bottom of the list currently 
it takes a long time with hitting the "see more" button. I want to either increase the number of cities 
loaded each time the button is pressed, or to change from a "see more" button to a scroll bar or dropdown menu 
broken down states to cities (i.e. user selects state (alabama) then is given the cities to choose from (auburn, 
birmingham, huntsville, mobile, montgomery). 
But I can not for the life of me find the script I need to edit.
